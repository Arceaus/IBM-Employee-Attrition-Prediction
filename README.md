# 📊 IBM Employee Attrition Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on HR-related features.

The application is built using **Logistic Regression**, provides **SHAP explainability**, supports **single and bulk predictions**, and is deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**.

## 📊 Dataset

**Dataset:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset

The dataset contains employee-related information such as:

- Age
- Department
- Job Role
- Monthly Income
- Job Satisfaction
- OverTime
- Work-Life Balance
- Distance From Home
- Years at Company
- and many more HR features.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

**Algorithm Used**

- Logistic Regression (Class Weight Balanced)

The model predicts:

- High Attrition Risk
- Low Attrition Risk

Decision Threshold:

## 🧠 Explainable AI

This project uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to explain every prediction.

The waterfall chart shows:

- Features increasing attrition risk
- Features decreasing attrition risk
- Individual contribution of each feature
